# 2017 Unity2d Project - Skystorm

Working in Unity version 5.6.0f3
Will not work in newer Unity versions yet do to deprecations.


Skystorm is an attempt at creating a game similar Flying Shark from 1987 in Unity.
Currently features 4 levels with a boss fight on the final level.


TODO: 
- Remove steamworks integration for standalone builds
- Upgrade to lastest Unity versions
- Add more levels and pick up where I left off back in 2017
